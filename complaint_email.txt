Subject: URGENT - Defective Product Complaint - Order #12345
Date: Mon, 15 Jan 2024 14:30:00 GMT

Dear Customer Service Team,

I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with my recent purchase from your company. Order #12345, placed on January 5th, arrived yesterday in completely unacceptable condition.

Issues encountered:
1. The main product unit was visibly damaged with scratches and dents
2. Several components were missing from the package
3. The instruction manual was water-damaged and illegible
4. The product doesn't match the specifications listed on your website

This is the THIRD time I've had quality issues with your products, and my patience is completely exhausted. As a business owner, these delays and defects are causing serious disruptions to my operations.

I DEMAND:
- Immediate replacement of the entire order with quality-checked items
- Full refund of shipping costs for both deliveries
- Compensation for business losses caused by these delays
- Escalation to management level for review of your quality control processes

If this matter is not resolved within 24 hours, I will be forced to:
- File complaints with consumer protection agencies
- Share my negative experience on social media and review platforms
- Consider legal action for breach of contract

I expect immediate action and a detailed response plan.

Furiously disappointed,
John Smith
